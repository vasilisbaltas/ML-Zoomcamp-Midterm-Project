# ML-Zoomcamp-Midterm-Project
The subject of this project is time series forecasting. More specifically, forecasting car sales in Norway. The choice of this project is related to my 
job because at the moment I am building a forecasting engine for my company. So, it was really helpful for me to expand my knowledge and I will be able to
apply new things to my professional environment.

Time series forecasting is a classic area of machine learning applications (just like classification and regression). It is a really interesting topic and there is a lot 
of research around it. In this project I did not applied the classic statistical approaches like Holt-Winters and the ARIMA family. I wanted to experiment with the use
of the machine learning models that we studied in the bootcamp. The key point of the whole effort is to transform the data into a form that is understandable from the
scikit-learn libraries and XGBoost. This means that I had to transform my data in a form that the formula F(X) = Y could be applied.
